# Detecting-Rotator-Cuff-Tear-in-Magnetic-Resonance-Images-using-Local-Features-and-Machine-Learning-t

How to run the code:
Data preprocessing: if you want to use augmented data then run the code data_pre_process.py (update the paths in code accordingly)
Feature extraction: to perfom Hough + Hog, run hog.py, for sift and surf, run SIFT.py (uncomment sift while executing it, and uncomment surf part while executing it. Also, update the paths accordingly)
splitting data to training and testing sets: run the code train_split.py (update the paths and split the training and testing sets according to your needs)
converting data to IDX format: run the code mnist_create.py (update the paths accordingly), these data sets will be used in the machine learning models)
Running the models: run the mnist_create.py file to create test and training idx files with labels for each of HOG, SIFT, SURF
then place all the 4 files generated by mnist_create.py in the folder MNIST_dataset_loader/dataset under each model's folder
then for KNN, run knn.py, for SVM, run svm.py, for CNN run cnn_code.py.
